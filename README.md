                                                    𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴:🧹
●The first step was to clean the raw data.
●Filled all missing values
●Checked whether the column holds the same data type or not

                                                   𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 :
After cleaning the data, the next step was to prepare it for analysis. This involved organizing the data into a format that could be easily analyzed, such as creating tables and grouping data.

●I created separate columns and found that based on age whether they are Teenage, Adult, or senior citizen using Excel Builtin function IF()
●The month column was created and based on the date it shows which month in string format:- Text(value, Format)📅📝

                                                    𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 :🔍
With the data cleaned and prepared, I began analyzing it to identify trends, patterns, and insights. I began preparing Pivot tables & charts by dragging and dropping columns, and rows into worksheets and trying to see how data turns into meaningful insight.

                                                    𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 :
Lastly, I built a dashboard to present the findings of my analysis. Combined all the charts into one worksheet, added a slicer, and connected them to every Pivot chart to make it dynamic.

> 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁: March Sales, Customer Shopping Behavior, and Order Data📈💻🛍️

●In the month of March, sales were higher than in previous months.
●Women tend to shop more than men, with adult women making more purchases than teenagers and senior citizens.
●The majority of orders came from Amazon.

Suggestions to the business based on the report: 💡💼

●Increase advertising on Amazon: As the majority of orders are coming from Amazon. 💻📊
●Focus on adult women: Since adult women are the most active shoppers. 👩‍👧💸💁‍♀️
